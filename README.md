### Text PreProcessing using NLTK

### Tokenization 

### 1. Stemming
Taking a word and Reducing it to its Word Stem
[eating,eaten,ate] ---> eat
[going,goes,gone] ----> go

#### Porter Stemmer : Automatic, Fast but low accuracy
#### Regexp Stemmer : Initliaze the suffix we need to clean/remove from the word. Not Automatic
#### SnowBall stemmer : Better than Porter Stemmer. 


### 2. Word Net Lemmatizer (Lemmatization)
- Great Accuracy compared to stem but slower.

### 3. Stop Words :
- StopWords are use to minimize the paragraph, it removes word that doesn't add any potential meaning to the paragraph
